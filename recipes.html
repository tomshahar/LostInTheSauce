        1 cup Unsalted Butter <br>
        1 cup White Sugar <br>
        1 cup Brown Sugar <br>
        2 Large Eggs <br>
        1.5 tsp Vanilla Extract <br>
        0.5 tsp Orange Extract <br>
        2 tsp Coffee <br>
        1 tsp Baking Soda <br>

        Instructions
      </h2>
      <p class = "recipe-instructions">
        Preheat oven to 360 degrees. If you have convection, use it. Soften butter for 15 seconds in the microwave. In the bowl of a stand mixer,
        cream together the butter and both sugars until fully combined. Add the eggs, and mix until just incorporated. <br><br>Add the vanilla, orange,
        coffee, baking soda, and salt. Mix until fully combined. <br><br>Add flour in iterations of 1 cup. The dough should be slightly sticky when pressed.
        Take a spoonful and tilt it; the dough should stick to the spoon completely, not fall down. You may find that less that 3 cups of flour gives
        better dough, so add the last cup in smaller iterations. <br><br>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and scoop balls of dough of about 2.5 tbsp
        each, 6 cookies per batch. Bake for between 8 and 10 minutes, then let cool for at least 2 minutes on the baking sheet.
